// PACKAGES
// A package is just a directory with one or more files of code, as well as a package.json file
// that contains information about the code in the package.

// DEPENDENCIES
// When you start to use more modules, youâ€™ll find that some of them depend on other modules to
// work. These are known as dependencies.


// npm allows you to install JavaScript packages onto your machine. Some packages
// rely on other packages, so npm acts as a dependency manager. For example, if
// you use npm to install a package, it will also install all the packages that the
// original package depends on as well.


// SEARCHING FOR PACKAGES
// To find a package, you can use the search command

// >> npm search test

// CREATING A NEW PACKAGES
// TO INITIALIZE A DIRECTORY AS PACKAGE DIRECTORY
